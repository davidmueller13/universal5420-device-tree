THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS!

#############################

This is a device tree for the Exynos5420-based universal5420 board from Samsung to be used with the n1a / lt03 variant, or more specifically the WiFi and 3G models (SM-P600/P601) of Samsung's Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 Edition. When complete, it should then be possible to use this code as a foundation for other universal5420-based device trees.

I am by no means a programming expert, and this is my first time working with the device tree syntax and I'm sure there's a bunch of errors and unneccesary code to be found. If anyone familiar with this syntax could review my code and give it some constructive criticism, it would be highly appreciated.

For reference I have included the stock board files from the SM-P600 kernel (Linux 3.4) as well as other Exynos5420-based device trees.

Most, if not all, unit addresses are found in /refs-board/include/mach/map.h (where /refs-board = /arch/arm/mach-exynos).
Other reference files:

"board-universal5420-*.c",
"board-n1-*.c",
"board-lt03-*.c"
"dev-*.c"

Of course, all files that refer to "universal5420" in their names are probably worth looking into.

I have also included official documentation files and some datasheets in the refs-docs directory.
